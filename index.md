<p align="justify">
Gathered and integrated several datasets to perform a data analysis of the viral vulnerability of different neighbourhoods in Sydney. The vulnerability score was computed for all suburbs in the greater Sydney region which is a measure of several factors that affect the spread of a virus within a community such as: population density, age distribution, pre-existing health conditions, and access to healthcare services.

<p align="justify">
Created an R Shiny app to visualise the relationship between COVID-19 and other student lifestyle factors. The following dynamic hypothesis tests were supported: Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Tests for Uniformity Tests, Chi-squared Test for Independence Tests, One sample t-test Tests and Two sample t-test for unequal population variance.
